# MVP: Youtube Channel Data

I collected a big dataset of 100,000+ rows of YouTube channels. After data cleaning and EDA via SQL and PySpark, I was able to create a workbook in Tableau.

My end product will be a fully developed Tableau Dashboard allowing for data analysis by user-specified filters. Users will be able to sort by Category to view analytics such as AVG(followers) per Category, or AVG(followers) per channel, or Followers/Videos ratio. I plan to implement algorithms to return TOP 10 Channels by Category as recommendations to the user.

Time permitting, I also plan to create a Flask web application that returns these types of visualization data based on drop down selections.

Below are some example visualization charts created in Tableau.
